# Loan Approval Prediction and Model Comparison

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Loan Approval Prediction** system using various machine learning algorithms such as **KNN**, **Naïve Bayes**, **SVM**, **Random Forest**, and **K-means**. The objective is to classify loan approval data based on input features and compare the performance of different models. An interactive **Shiny** application is developed to visualize the results and make model comparison easier for users.

## 🌟 Features
- **Model Comparison**: Compare the accuracy of KNN, Naïve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and K-means.
- **Shiny App**: Interactive web interface for real-time model comparison and result visualization.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and feature engineering for better model performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Display model evaluation results and feature importance through graphs.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **R Programming**: For machine learning and statistical analysis.
- **Shiny**: To build the interactive web-based application.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: KNN, Naïve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, K-means.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `caret`, `randomForest`, `e1071`, `class`, `kmeans`, `shiny`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`.
